My name is Adonis Ezzeddine, I'm a Computer and Communications Engineer and I've been working in different IT and Engineering areas since I got my degree back in 2019.
I have experience as Technical and Customer Support Engineer.

The technology industry is constantly evolving, so keeping updated in the new trends becomes crucial for everybody working in IT.
Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Cybersecurity are some of my areas of interest. 
One big topic nowadays in Technology is the Cloud Computing, and actually it is a passion for me to learn; 
Therefore I've decided to start acquiring the skills relevant to this technology through the available providers resources and certifications like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
